        <h1>A Little bit about me</h1>
            <p>I'm 43, married to a wonderful man for 20 years.  We have four beautiful kids who are all happy
                and healthy, and growing up to be the beautiful people God intented.   I have a BS in Interior Design and 
                have experience working with AutoCAD both commercially and residentially.  I stopped working rather suddenly, 
                as I was laid off the day before our second child was born.  Unfortunately for me, the economy bubble 
                burst only a few months later.  After a rather long effort to find work, and the addition of two more children,
                financially, it made more sense for me to stay home and care for our children rather than go back to work.  Fast forward to now,
                nine years later, and we are on the cusp of all four of our children being school aged for the first time.  It has become 
                my intention, that it is time for me to return to the workforce.  This is about where I go from here. </p>
