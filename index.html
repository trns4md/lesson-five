            <p>I'm Becky, I am interested in perhaps blogging about the experience of reentering the workforce after taking time to raise my kids.
                I think it would be helpful to other women in the same boat if not a little cathartic for me to work through how this goes as well.
                Since I am running out of website ideas, this is what I came up with for an assignment.</p>
